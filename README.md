# UdaciRacer Simulation Game

This project is the final assignemnt in the Nanodegree "Intermediate Javascript" at Udacity. The goal of this project is to apply the knowledge of asynchronous programming by using Promises, async await and error handling. Within this assignment, the student receives a partially built-out race game; the job of the student is to complete it.

The game mechanics are this: you select a player and track, the game begins and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. The final view is a results page displaying the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:

1. The form to create a race

2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)

3. The race results view

Udacity supplies the student with the starter code, which includes:

1. An API. The API is provided in the form of a binary held in the bin folder. 

2. HTML Views. 

The starter code contains TO DO's that the student has to complete in order to finish the assignment.
